	<h1>Steps to host in github pages:-</h1>
	<h5><em><u>Note:-</u></em> If have already done the following steps/process kindly skip</h5>
	<h4>Step 1:-</h4>
		<ul>
			<p>-&gt; Create a repository.</p>
			<p>-&gt; Create a folder on your local machine where you are going to put all your files regarding your web page</p>
			<p>-&gt; Open your git terminal/bash on that folder and inistallize it using <strong>git init</strong> command.</p>
			<p>-&gt; paste the link that shown on the last it may seems like <i>git remote add origin https://github.com/{UserName}/{RepoName}.git</i></p>
			<p>-&gt; <b>If you are going to host an existing repository </b> clone that repo using <strong>git clone <i>https://github.com/{UserName}/{RepoName}.git</i></strong></p>
		</ul><hr>
	<h4>Step 2:-</h4>
		<ul>
			<p>-&gt; Create/Paste the html,css,js and so on files in your inistalized folder</p>
			<p>-&gt; add the files which are untracked by git by whole or one by one using the <strong>git add {filepath} or .</strong> command.</p>
			<p>-&gt; My personal suggestion is to go with filepath if you have a lot of specific/unique stuffs</p>
		</ul><hr>
	<h4>Step 3:-</h4>
		<ul>
			<p>-&gt; Commit your changes with this <strong>git commit -m "{message}"</strong> command.</p>
			<p>-&gt; {message} represents your own <b>valuable/useful</b> message use a proper one that make sense.</p>
			<p>-&gt; if all done here you go push it with <strong>git push --set-upstream origin {branchName}</strong> by default it is master have a doubt just type <strong>git push</strong> command it will show the correct one.</p>
		</ul><hr>
	<h4>Step 4:-</h4>
		<ul>
			<p>-&gt; Once you have completed all the above steps go to your web browser refresh or open your git repo page you should see all your uploaded files there.</p>
			<p>-&gt; Then go to settings search for github pages in that you can see the topic source.</p>
			<p>-&gt; In that topic you can see a dropDown box with none in it</p>
			<p>-&gt; Change that none value into your branchName by default it shows Master.</p>
			<p>-&gt; Save it and wait for few secs. <b><i>Hurray Your Page is Online Now.</i></b></p>
		</ul>
	<h4>Step 5:</h4>
		<ul>
			<p>-&gt; You can access your page with the url <b>https://{userName}.github.io/{RepoName}/{filePath}/fileName.extension</b></p>
			<p>-&gt; For My case its <a href="https://srinivasthedeveloper.github.io/WEB-DEVELOPMENT-2021/SRINIVAStheDEVELOPER/DAY1%20Html%20Tutorial(basic%20tags)/index.html">https://srinivasthedeveloper.github.io/WEB-DEVELOPMENT-2021/SRINIVAStheDEVELOPER/DAY1%20Html%20Tutorial(basic%20tags)/index.html</a></p>
